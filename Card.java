/**
 * Create a well-designed Card class with:
 * - int instance variables for suit and rank
 *     Suits: Spades (1), Hearts (2), Diamonds (3), Clubs (4)
 *     Ranks: Ace (1), 2-10, Jack (11), Queen (12), King (13)
 * - constants
 *   i.e. there should be no "magic numbers" in your code
 * - constructor that takes suit and rank parameters (in that order)
 * - accessors getSuit and getRank
 * - mutators setSuit and setRank
 * - public String getSuitString()
 *     return a String for the suit like Spades, Hearts, etc.
 * - public String getRankString()
 *     return a String for the rank like 4, 6, Jack, Queen, Ace, etc.
 * - public String toString()
 *     formatted exactly like these examples: 
 *     "9 of Spades", "Ace of Hearts", "King of Clubs"
 * - public equals(Object other)
 *     true if two cards have the same suits and ranks
