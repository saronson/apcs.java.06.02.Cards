# Cards

Card games are implemented well with objects. A card can be an object with instance variables for rank and suit. A deck can be an array of card objects.  

1.  Create a well-designed Card class with proper instance variables, accessors, mutators, constructors, toString and equals methods.  
    Look at instructions in Card.java
2.  Finish the Deck class that will hold 52 card objects.  
    Look at instructions in Deck.java
3.  Finish the BlackjackHand class.  
    Look at instructions in BlackjackHand.java
4.  Write the game of Blackjack as described in Main.java.
